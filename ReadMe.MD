# Terminal
WIP - learning hexo themeing as I go along.

# What is it? 
Terminal is a simple out of the Hexo theme used to Style a hexo site and make it look like a retro terminal / CRT style display. Think something along the lines of cheesy 'sci fi takes place on a hackers PC circa 1970s' kind of thing.

I'll update this once the theme has more teeth!
